## Abstract
This master thesis studies different classification algorithms within the frame of semi-supervised  learning (inductive) working with base classifiers (Decision tree, Naive Bayes...) using Spark ML. 

The main goal of this study is to design, implement, verify and build a library on Spark ML in order to make it easy to reuse on the any Spark environment.  
On the other hand, this project do an experimentation with different datasets where the main idea is to compare empirically the results between supervised algorithms /base classifiers (working with the samples labeled) and the semi-supervised algorithms working with semi-supervised (samples labeled and unlabeled). 
In order to analyze in more details, the outcomes and manage the huge number of data, this project has created a dashboard.

Finally, this project presents the conclusions and new lines of research working with the new library built (for Spark) in this research project as it has been described previously.
